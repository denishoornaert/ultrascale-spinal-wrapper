# SpinalHDL Base Project

**NOTE:** The content of the repository does not standalone: it only provides the support to ease and speed-up the generation of SpinalHDL written modules on AMD-Xilinx UltraScale+ platforms.
To get started, follow the guidelines provided hereunder and have a look at the example.

## List of supported boards

In theory most boards can be supported. However, you can find here a list of board supported (if listed) and tested (if checked).
