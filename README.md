# SpinalHDL Base Project

**NOTE:** The content of the repository does not standalone: it only provides the support to ease and speed-up the generation of SpinalHDL written modules on AMD-Xilinx UltraScale+ platforms.
To get started, follow the guidelines provided hereunder and have a look at the example.

## List of supported boards

In theory most boards can be supported. However, you can find here a list of board supported (if listed) and tested (if checked).

 - [x] AMD-Xilinx Kria KV260
 - [x] AMD-Xilinx Kria KR260
 - [ ] AMD-Xilinx ZCU102

## Vivado version tested

 - [x] Vivado 2022.2.2

**Let us know** if it works for you with another version!


## How to use the library (guidelines)

Soon to be added!

### Generate bitstream

Must be done from the root folder!
```bash

```
You will end up with `MyModule.bit` in the root folder.
